# geo_ubc_classes

This is a website to show the locations of all my registered classes on my schedule on the UBC Vancouver campus map. :)
Using python's matplotlib, pandas and deployment with streamlit.

Start date: 1 Aug 2024 (after much frustration and mock maps made on my VM using geopandas which started on 25 Jul 2024)
= I hope this one works :)
