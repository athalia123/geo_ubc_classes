# geo_ubc_classes

This is a website to show the locations of all my registered classes on my schedule on the UBC Vancouver campus map. :)
Using python's matplotlib, pandas and deployment with streamlit.

Systems used:
- python (programming language)
- streamlit (deployment tool)
- geopandas (geographical data manipulation and preparation)
- pandas (data manipulation and preparation)
- streamlit folium (streamlit custom library with folium library, interactive map tool for base map)
- mapbox (wayfinding and directions API)
- streamlit aggrid (streamlit custom package with aggrid, customizable tables on streamlit)
- jupyter notebook (for testing data manipulation before putting it in the app)
- OpenStreetMap (map provider)
- [UBC geospatial data Github](https://github.com/UBCGeodata/ubc-geospatial-opendata) (found on the UBC campus map planning website, ubc building geojson data source)

Start date: 7.00pm maybe 1 Aug 2024 (after much frustration and mock maps made on my VM using geopandas which started on 25 Jul 2024)
= I hope this one works :)

update: 2.24 am 2 Aug 2024 - oh my god, it does work. i'm getting there. turns out folium is so good for displaying maps, gotta love it ;) more features i want to add in "feature_list.txt". going to sleep now
